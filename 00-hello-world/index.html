  <!--
  The recommended approach in React is to use a container
  dive into load your react code into, rather than using `document.body`.

  This can be any element or tag name, just don't use `document.body`
  if you can avoid it.

  <div id="root"></div>

  <!--
  For ease of use, we are including the React, ReactDOM and Babel CDN
  builds to make getting started as fast as possible.

  In production, you'll want to instead look at using something
  like Gulp, Grunt or Webpack (Webpack is recommended)
  to compile JSX into Javascript. Also checkout:
